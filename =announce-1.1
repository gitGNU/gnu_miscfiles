X-Windows: Putting new limits on productivity.
--text follows this line--

I am pleased to announce version 1.1 of the GNU miscellaneous files
distribution, available via anonymous FTP from prep.ai.mit.edu
[18.159.0.42] in the file /pub/gnu/miscfiles-1.1.tar.gz (about 2.1 MB
compressed).

This distribution includes files not of crucial importance for system
administration or operation, but which have come to be common on
various systems over the years, including word lists, airport codes,
zipcodes and more.

This distribution does not include any programs.

In addition to many new files in this release, the na.phones database
has been entirely rebuilt.

The current list of files is:

connectives web2 web2a airport birthtoken inter.phone na.phone
operator zipcodes abbrevs.talk abbrevs.gen cities.dat postal.codes
latin1 languages mailinglists GNU-manifesto tasks.texi tasks.info
jarg400.info rfc-index.txt fyi-index.txt std-index.txt us-constitution
us-declaration

If you have any suggestions about files to add to this distribution,
or corrections to the files here, please send them to
bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.

My wish list for specific additions:

* I would like it if residents of various non-US countries could
verify the contents of inter.phone and suggest appropriate
modifications and additions.  I am particularly uncertain about
Austria, Denmark, France, Norway, and Yugoslavia.

* There is uncertainty about the state of area codes for Los Angeles,
Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, and Houston.  Anyone who really knows what's
going on is invited to please check na.phone and suggest appropriate
modifications.

* Word lists for other major languages would be very nice.

* A Unicode map (something like ascii and latin1) would be very nice.

* I have not found electronic sources for fully up-to-date zipcode and
airport code files.  Anyone who has a more current and complete
database is eagerly invited to let me know.

* Suggestions of particular internet standards to distribute (as well
as Usenet [and other] FAQs) would be nice.


See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

Please send all bug reports by electronic mail to:
    bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu

These files are all freely redistributable.
