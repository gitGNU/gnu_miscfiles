About the GNU Task List
***********************

   If you did not obtain this file directly from the GNU project and
recently, please check for a newer version.  You can ftp the task list
from any GNU FTP host in directory `/pub/gnu/tasks/'.  The task list is
available there in several different formats: `tasks.text',
`tasks.texi', `tasks.info', and `tasks.dvi'.  The GNU HURD task list is
also there in file `tasks.hurd'.  The task list is also available on
the GNU World Wide Web server: `http://www.gnu.org/prep/tasks_toc.html'.

   If you start working steadily on a project, please let <gvc@gnu.org>
know.  We might have information that could help you; we'd also like to
send you the GNU coding standards.

   Because of the natural tendency for most volunteers to write
programming tools or programming languages, we have a comparative
shortage of applications useful for non-programmer users.  Therefore,
we ask you to consider writing such a program.

   Typically, a new program that does a completely new job advances the
GNU project, and the free software community, more than an improvement
to an existing program.

   Typically, new features or new programs advance the free software
community more, in the long run, than porting existing programs.  One
reason is that portable new features and programs benefit people on many
platforms, not just one.  At the same time, there tend to be many
volunteers for porting--so your help will be more valuable in other
areas, where volunteers are more scarce.

   Typically, it is more useful to extend a program in functionality
than to improve performance.  Users who use the new functionality will
appreciate it very much, if they use it; but even when they benefit from
a performance improvement, they may not consider it very important.

   Finally, if you think of an important job that free software cannot
solve yet that is typically solved by proprietary software, please send
a short description of that job to <tasks@gnu.org> so that we can add
it to this task list.

Highest Priority
****************

   This task list mentions a large number of tasks that would be more or
less useful.  With luck, at least one of them will inspire you to start
writing.  It's better for you to work on any task that inspires you than
not write free software at all.

   But if you would like to work on what we need most, here is a list of
high priority projects.

   *  If you are good at writing documentation, please do that.  Pick a
     system or program you like, and write a Free tutorial or manual
     for it.

   *  Help to finish the missing features of the `docbook2texi' so that
     as many Docbook tags as possible can be translated into reasonable
     Texinfo.  See `http://docbook2x.sourceforge.net/todo.html' for a
     task list of what needs to be done.

   * If you are very good at C programming and interested in kernels,
     you can help develop the GNU HURD, the kernel for the GNU system.
     Please have a look at
     `http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html', and then get a copy
     of the latest HURD task list from:

        * `http://www.gnu.org/prep/tasks.hurd.html', via the World Wide
          Web.

        * `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/tasks/tasks.hurd', via anonymous
          FTP.

        * <gvc@gnu.org> via e-mail.


   * If you are a Scheme fan, you can help develop Guile.  Please have
     a look at the URL `http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html'
     and then contact the Guile developers at <guile-devel@gnu.org>.

   * Improve the facilities for translating other languages into Scheme,
     so that Guile can provide support for a variety of languages.

   * A package to convert programs written using MS Access into Scheme,
     making use of a free data base system and the GTK toolkit.

   * A general-purpose document viewing program that can handle
     PostScript, DVI, PDF, HTML, RTF, Word format and Word Perfect
     format.

   * Help develop software to emulate Windows NT on top of GNU systems.
     For example, you could help work on Willows Twin.  See
     `http://www.willows.com/'.

   *   * A free replacement for pdflib. This is a library for generating
     PDF.

   * Add gettext support to GNU programs that don't have it already.
     (Please contact the developers of the specific packages that you
     want to work on.)

   * Develop a substitute, which runs on GNU systems, for some very
     popular or very important application that many non-programmers
     use on Windows, and which has no comparable free equivalent now.

Documentation
*************

   We very urgently need documentation for many existing parts of the
system.

   Note that there are proprietary manuals for many of these topics, but
proprietary manuals do not count, for the same reason proprietary
software does not count: we are not free to copy and modify them.  We
do not recommend any non-free materials as documentation.

   * A reference document for SQL for use as a standard for
     implementors of free software versions of SQL.

   * A manual for libstdc++.

   * A unified manual for LaTeX.  (Existing documentation is non-free.)

   * A manual for Docbook SGML format.

   * A tutorial introduction to Midnight Commander.

   * A thorough manual for RCS.

   * A reference manual for Mach.

   * A reference manual for the GNU Hurd features in GNU libc.

   * A manual for writing Hurd servers.

   * A manual for GNU sed.

   * Reference manuals for C++, Objective C, Pascal, Fortran 77, and
     Java.

   * A tutorial manual for the C++ STL (standard template library).

   * A tutorial manual for Gforth.

   * GNU Objective-C Runtime Library Manual; this would be a reference
     manual for the runtime library functions, structures, and classes.
     Some work has been done on this job.

   * Manuals for GNUstep: developer tutorial, developer programming
     manual, developer reference manual, and user manual.

   * A manual for Ghostscript.

   * A manual for TCSH.

   * A coherent free reference manual for Perl.  Most of the Perl
     on-line reference documentation can be used as a starting point,
     but work is needed to weld them together into a coherent manual.

   *  A good free Perl language tutorial introduction.  The existing
     Perl introductions are published with restrictions on copying and
     modification, so that they cannot be part of a GNU system.  bkuhn
     made a start at a free tutorial, but a lot of work is needed.

   * A manual for PIC (the graphics formatting language).

   * A book on how GCC works and why various machine descriptions are
     written as they are.

   * A manual for programming applications for X11.

   * Manuals for various X window managers.

   * Reference cards for those manuals that don't have them: C
     Compiler, Make, Texinfo, Termcap, and maybe the C Library.

   * Many utilities still need documentation.

Unix-Related Projects
*********************

   * Less urgent: make a replacement for the "writer's workbench"
     program `style', or something to do the same kind of job.
     Compatibility with Unix is not especially important for this
     program.

   * Rewrite `indent' from scratch to make it cleaner.

   * Write a free software replacement for the `agrep' program.



File: tasks.info,  Node: Kernel Projects,  Next: Extensions,  Prev: Unix-Related Projects,  Up: Top

Kernel-Related Projects
***********************

   * An over-the-ethernet debugger stub that will allow the kernel to be
     debugged from GDB running on another machine.

     This stub needs its own self-contained implementation of all
     protocols to be used, since the GNU system will use user processes
     to implement all but the lowest levels, and the stub won't be able
     to use those processes.  If a simple self-contained implementation
     of IP and TCP is impractical, it might be necessary to design a
     new, simple protocol based directly on ethernet.  It's not crucial
     to support high speed or communicating across gateways.

     It might be possible to use the Mach ethernet driver code, but it
     would need some changes.

   * A shared memory X11 server to run under MACH is very desirable.
     The machine specific parts should be kept well separated.

   * An implementation of CIFS, the "Common Internet File System," for
     the HURD.  This protocol is an offshoot of SMB.

   * Support (in Linux?) for dumping the non-textual contents of an SVGA
     console.


File: tasks.info,  Node: Extensions,  Next: Java Projects,  Prev: Kernel Projects,  Up: Top

Extensions to Existing GNU Software
***********************************

   * Enhance GCC.  See files `PROJECTS' and `PROBLEMS' in the GCC
     distribution.

   * Interface GDB to Guile, so that users can write debugging commands
     in Scheme.  This would also make it possible to write, in Scheme, a
     graphical interface that uses GTK and is tightly integrated into
     GDB.

   * Extend Octave to support programs that were written to run on
     Khoros.

   * Rewrite Automake in Scheme, so it can run in Guile.  Right now it
     is written in Perl.  There are also other programs, not terribly
     long, which we would also like to have rewritten in Scheme.

   * Finish the partially-implemented C interpreter project.

   * Help with the development of GNUstep, a GNU implementation of the
     OpenStep specification.

   * Add features to GNU Make to record the precise rule with which
     each file was last recompiled; then recompile any file if its rule
     in the makefile has changed.

   * Add a few features to GNU `diff', such as handling large input
     files without reading entire files into core.

   * An `nroff' macro package to simplify `texi2roff'.

   * A queueing system for the mailer Smail that groups pending work by
     destination rather than by original message.  This makes it
     possible to schedule retries coherently for each destination.
     Talk to <tron@veritas.com> and <woods@weird.com> about this.



File: tasks.info,  Node: Java Projects,  Next: X Windows Projects,  Prev: Extensions,  Up: Top

Java Projects
*************

   * Write a replacement for the javadoc utility.  The Classpath
     (`http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath') team has already made a
     start to one.



File: tasks.info,  Node: X Windows Projects,  Next: Network Projects,  Prev: Java Projects,  Up: Top

X Windows Projects
******************

   * An emulator for Macintosh graphics calls on top of X Windows.

   *  A package that emulates the API of Visual C++'s Foundation Classes
     (MFC), but operates on top of X11.  It need not match the screen
     appearance provided by MFC.  Instead, it would be best to use GTK,
     so as to give coherence with GNOME.

   * Make sure the Vibrant toolkit works with LessTif instead of Motif.

   * A program to display and edit Hypercard stacks.

   * A two-dimensional outliner program, which lets you draw graph
     structures of textual items, and then display them in various ways.



File: tasks.info,  Node: Network Projects,  Next: Encryption Projects,  Prev: X Windows Projects,  Up: Top

Network Projects
****************



File: tasks.info,  Node: Encryption Projects,  Next: Other Projects,  Prev: Network Projects,  Up: Top

Encryption Projects
*******************

   These projects need to be written outside the US by people who are
not US citizens, to avoid problems with US export control law.

   * Free software for doing secure commercial transactions on the web.
     This should be based on libcrypt and GNUtls.


File: tasks.info,  Node: Other Projects,  Next: Languages,  Prev: Encryption Projects,  Up: Top

Other Projects
**************

   If you think of others that should be added, please send them to
<tasks@gnu.org>.

   *  Maintain a library for automatic graph layout.  VCG might provide
     a base for this.  Make sure there is a front end for manual and
     interactive intervention so that the result is a full substitute
     for equivalent proprietory software

   *  A "one stop shopping system" for advocates involved with social
     justice or other non-profit campaigns.  The idea would be to
     create an easy-to-use interface to software that would allow
     someone to register a domain for their organisation, build a
     website, and set up mailing lists.  The software would need
     options to easily do all this, and be made easy for non-hackers.
     Mainly the work would involve bringing together a number of
     existing tools with an overriding configuration program.

   * An imitation of Page Maker or Ventura Publisher.

   * An imitation of `dbase2' or `dbase3'.  (How dbased!)  Harbour, a
     free replacement for Clipper, would provide a useful start.
     `http://www.harbour-project.org/'.

   * A free replacement for Glimpse, which is not free software.  Swish
     does some parts of the job, but not all.

   * Software for desktop publishing.  We are extending Emacs into a
     WYSIWYG word processor, to handle primarily linear text; what this
     item proposes is software focused on page layout.

   * A program to play sound distributed in "Real Audio" format.

   * A program to generate "Real Audio" format from audio input.

   * Programs to handle audio in RTSP format.

   * A braille translation and formatting system which can convert
     marked up documents into braille.  This should let the user
     customize the braille translation rules; it would be good to
     divide it into a device-independent part plus drivers.  Contact
     Jason White, <jasonw@ariel.ucs.unimelb.EDU.AU>.

   * More scientific mathematical subroutines.  (A clone of SPSS is
     being written already.)

   * A scientific data collection and processing tool, perhaps
     something like Scientific Workbench and/or Khoros,

   * A program to calculate properties of molecules by solving the
     Schroedinger equation.

   * Software to replace card catalogs in libraries.

   * A simulator for heating and air conditioning systems for buildings.

   * A package for editing genealogical records conveniently.  This
     could perhaps be done as a Gnome program, or perhaps as an Emacs
     extension.

   * Grammar and style checking programs.

   * A diagnostic program to test a hard disk.

   * Optical character recognition programs; especially if suitable for
     scanning documents with multiple fonts and capturing font info as
     well as character codes.  Work is being done on this, but more
     help is needed.

   * A program to scan a line drawing and convert it to editable
     Postscript, or some other editable format.

   * A program to recognize handwriting (we don't believe PocketLinux's
     handwriting capability is ready for non-PocketLinux environments,
     yet).

   * A program that can translate from one natural language, into
     another.  For example, a program to translate French into English.

   * CAD software, such as a vague imitation of Autocad.

   * A program to receive data from a serial-line tap to facilitate the
     reverse-engineering of communication protocols.

   * A database program designed to store and retrieve patent
     information.

   * A free software package to run on a Palm Pilot in place of its
     usual software, doing more or less the usual jobs.  (Linux, the
     kernel, has apparently been ported, but according to what we hear
     this port is not useful yet.)

Programming Languages
*********************

   Volunteers are needed to write parsers/front ends for languages such
as Algol 60, Algol 68, PL/I, Cobol, Fortran 90, Delphi, Modula 2,
Modula 3, RPG, and any other languages designed for compilation, to be
used with the code generation phases of the GNU C compiler.

   You can get the status of the Fortran front end with this command:

     finger -l fortran@gnu.org

   We would like to have translators from various languages into Scheme.
These languages include TCL, Python, Perl, Java, Javascript, and Rexx.
Perhaps Clipper as well.


File: tasks.info,  Node: Education,  Next: Games and Recreations,  Prev: Languages,  Up: Top

Education
*********

   Programs for studying, teaching or doing administrative tasks in
schools.  See `http://www.gnu.org/education/' for additional
information.

   * A program to organize automatically the schedule of a school given
     constraints about teachers, rooms, times, and students.

   * A program to edit dance notation (such as labanotation) and display
     dancers moving on the screen.  Gepetto does some of this work.
     Contact <gvc@gnu.org> if you are interested in helping finish the
     job.



File: tasks.info,  Node: Games and Recreations,  Prev: Education,  Up: Top

Games and Recreations
*********************

   Video-oriented games that work with the X window system.

   * Empire (there is a free version but it needs upgrading)

   * An "empire builder" system that makes it easy to write various
     kinds of simulation games.

   * Improve GnuGo `http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/gnugo.html',
     which is not yet very sophisticated.

   * Network servers and clients for board and card games for which such
     software does not yet exist.

   * A Hierarchical Task Network package which can be used to program
     play the computer's side in various strategic games.

   * A game like Mill/Nine Men's Morris.

   * Write imitations of some popular video games:

        - Space war, Asteroids, Pong, Columns.

        - Defending cities from missiles.

        - Plane shoots at lots of other planes, tanks, etc.

        - Wizard fights fanciful monsters.

        - A golf game.

        - Biomorph evolution (as in Scientific American and `The Blind
          Watchmaker').

   We do not need `rogue', as we have `hack'.
